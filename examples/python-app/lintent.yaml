# lintent.yaml - Semantic meaning for lint rules
# Linters are auto-detected from pyproject.toml

rules:
  ruff:
    E501:
      illegal: "Lines over 88 characters"
      legal: "Break into multiple lines or extract to named variables"
      why: "Readability - code should fit in viewport without horizontal scrolling"
    
    F401:
      illegal: "Importing modules that are not used"
      legal: "Only import what you use, or mark with # noqa: F401 if for side-effects"
      why: "Clean dependency graph, faster startup, clearer code"
    
    F841:
      illegal: "Assigning to a variable that is never read"
      legal: "Use the variable, remove the assignment, or prefix with _ if intentional"
      why: "Dead code indicates logic errors or incomplete refactoring"
    
    I001:
      illegal: "Imports not sorted correctly"
      legal: "Group imports: stdlib, third-party, local. Sort alphabetically within groups"
      why: "Consistent import ordering makes dependencies scannable"
    
    B006:
      illegal: "Mutable default argument in function definition"
      legal: "Use None as default and create mutable inside function body"
      why: "Mutable defaults are shared across calls, causing subtle bugs"
    
    C901:
      illegal: "Function is too complex (high cyclomatic complexity)"
      legal: "Break into smaller functions with single responsibilities"
      why: "Complex functions are hard to test, understand, and maintain"

  pyright:
    reportMissingTypeStubs:
      illegal: "Using untyped libraries without acknowledgment"
      legal: "Install type stubs (types-*), use py.typed packages, or add explicit ignore"
      why: "Type boundaries must be explicit for full type safety"
    
    reportUnusedVariable:
      illegal: "Variable declared but never read"
      legal: "Use the variable or prefix with _ to indicate intentional discard"
      why: "Unused variables suggest incomplete logic or dead code"
    
    reportMissingParameterType:
      illegal: "Function parameter without type annotation"
      legal: "Add type hints: def func(param: Type) -> ReturnType"
      why: "Type annotations enable tooling and catch errors at edit time"
    
    reportGeneralTypeIssues:
      illegal: "Type mismatch or incompatible types"
      legal: "Fix the type error or use explicit type narrowing"
      why: "Type errors often indicate logic bugs that would fail at runtime"
